## Introduction

Within the cyber world, there is a constant battle between viruses and antivirus software. Due to computers evolving at an exponential rate, so are the techniques of virus development and mitigation. In this paper I aim to understand the extent to which the stock antivirus system Windows Defender is able to prevent malicious executables from being run on a stock Windows machine. With this data, I will conclude how effective Windows Defender is when different forms of evasion are used.

This research will focus on evaluating the effectiveness of different virus creation tools for Windows 10 I have chosen to focus on the Windows 10 operating system due to the market share in operating systems, with Windows holding a substantial percentage. "As of December 2020, over 76% of all computers worldwide were running some version of Windows" [@zaharia2024cyber]. Having such a large share in the market means that an attacker’s priority when trying to infect a machine is mainly aimed at a Windows machine; by evaluating the effectiveness of Windows Defender, we will be able to understand the possible future mitigations to be put in place so that all devices are protected from a multitude of potential viruses.

There are many types of viruses, but the one I will be focussing on is mainly a Remote access Trojan (RAT). The reason I have chosen to focus on a RAT is due to the severity and impact it can cause on a user. Remote access aims to gain full access to the victim’s machine and can open up doors to more attacks. By understanding how these viruses are created and the techniques used to obfuscate code avoiding AV will allow us to put in the necessary protection mechanisms to defeat malicious users.

As discussed in Section 1 above, as Windows holds a majority share in the market when it comes to computers, there are a range of tools that can be used to create effective viruses. The impact of these tools regarding AV detection is continuously altering, and therefore, the environment is rapidly changing. With plenty of innovations from both attackers and defenders, it is not easy to produce long-lasting solutions.

Up-to-date sources indicate that "560,000 new pieces of malware are detected every day" [@jovanovic2023malware]. With this vast number of potentially 0-day viruses being created every day, there is no way that antivirus software can keep up and block all these threats before they infect multiple machines.

[@jovanovic2023malware] Also says that "Every minute, four companies fall victim to ransomware attacks" This relates nicely to [@samarati2017cyber] report on how much cybercrime cost the UK in 2016, "Although ransomware ranked last in terms of the number of organisations affected (388,858), it ranked first in terms of financial losses (£7,356,060,699)". These statistics show us that more resources need to be dedicated to researching the techniques that attackers use to produce malware. After understanding why Antivirus is evaded, we will then be able to mitigate the impact of readily available tools and protect our computers. The reason so many organisations were affected is due to evasion techniques such as obfuscation and cryptography. Encoding and changing the structure of the payload will bypass specific detection techniques, such as signature-based scanning and potentially heuristic-based scanning, depending on the severity of the obfuscation. Also, techniques such as polymorphic code will allow code to be changed every time the program is run, further evading Antivirus by constantly changing its signature.

Antivirus software is arguably one of the most critical processes on our computers, blocking internal and external threats and protecting our computers from malicious users. My projects will be important to the blue and red teams within cybersecurity. With more excellent knowledge of how antivirus systems cope with different forms of evasion, will ensure that new protections are put in place to secure devices further. Also, I'm positive that my research will also benefit individual users who have little knowledge of cyber threats. Reasoning for this is that demonstrating the different ways in which a virus can come will encourage users to be more cautious when opening a file from an unsigned source. Furthermore, antivirus developers will be able to use my research to locate the flaws in any existing products. If a particular technique used guarantees antivirus evasion, then developers will be able to rectify any mistakes.

<!--Talk about what the project is and what the project is not -->

### Aims and objectives:

-      How well do off-the-shelf tools evade antivirus?

-      What are the key characteristics of a virus?

-      What behaviours cause Antivirus to flag a file as malicious?

-      What techniques, if any, can be used to evade Antivirus?

Need to talk more about aims and objectives

## Legal and Ethical considerations:
#### Legal
Throughout this project I will be researching and developing computer viruses, and therefore bare any responsibility over the programs I create and how they are used. Because legal considerations around Computer Misuse Act (1990) and Civil Liability Laws, all versions of computer virus that are created will be tested locally. This means that we wont address how viruses spread over the internet, but we will dive into how well AV detects them once on a "victims" computer. During this research no data will be lost or destroyed and no person(s) will be affected by my research. 
#### Ethical
As my research explores the techniques and mindset that a malware developer may use there are some ethical implications. Firstly, any working code that bypasses AV will be concealed as to not encourage readers to use for malicious reasons. Secondly, I will practice responsible disclosure. In the case that my research leads to a security hole being uncovered, this will be reported to the relevant parties. Lastly, I will ensure that the intentions of my research are purely educational.

## Literature review:

### Computer viruses
There are many different types of computer virus but the one that I intend to research is the Trojan horse virus. [@The_Editors_of_Encyclopaedia_2022] Describes this as a type of malicious computer software, usually disguised within a legitimate or beneficial program. Once this software is installed on a users computer, the trojan will allow the attacker remote access to the victims computer. Remote access gives the attacker a very threatening position, with the ability to access all computer files, applications and data, the attacker has the opportunity to steal and sell your confidential data [@Bhardwaj_2022]. 
In this paper by [@robinson2017s] The capturing of personal data was valued at US$60 for each internet user at the time (2012). Although outdated this paper sets an example of how personal data can be sold for profit. This breach in personal data can have a snowball affect of implications on the user and even cause problems such as identity theft and financial loss. Moreover, when data is lost from a company due to virus related incidents, this can cause reputation damage and consequently loss of revenue.

### Computer virus history
#### ILOVEYOU Virus
Computer viruses have been around since early computer development. One of the most significant computer viruses was the "ILOVEYOU" virus. The web article by [@Root_2022] explains the computer virus would be received via email and appear to be a text document described as a "Love letter coming from me". However, most users didnt realise the file received was a VBS script which ran a program to corrupt documents on the hard drive and then replicate itself through the use of your address book, and access to the email account. 
This virus certainly wasn't the first to abuse this exploit, but it was a pivotal moment for malware development and the damages incurred are estimated at about $10 billion.

#### Zeus Virus
https://www.cynet.com/malware/zeus-malware-variants-methods-and-history/ <!-- might have to find a different reference to this as its tryna sell av solution -->

Zeus/Zbot was a malware package that used a client/server model (Trojan). The main function of Zeus was to gain unauthorised access to financial systems by stealing credentials, banking information and financial data. This virus over the years infected over 3 million computers in the US, including companies such as NASA and the Bank of America. Zeus disguised it self as legitimate software and enables the malware when it spots the use of a banking site or financial transaction. 
Zeus was so successful in infecting machines, there was two common ways this was done. Firstly, Drive-by-downloads. This involved compromising legitimate websites and exploiting known browser and operating system vulnerabilities to download the Zeus malware when a user accessed the site.
Secondly, As Zeus grew it gained the ability to infiltrate user accounts on social media and over email. With the compromised accounts Zeus would be able to create phishing messages tricking users into downloading this malware.

### Lifecycle of a computer virus
The author [@alrawi2021circle] looks to investigate the life cycle of a virus. Upon reading the paper, a framework is creates where the lifecycle can be broken down into five simple components.
1) The infection vector; This is how the malware attacks a system
2) The payload; This is the dropped malware code after exploitation
3) Persistence; This is how the malware installs on a system
4) Capabilities; The functions in the malware code
5) C&C infrastructure; How the malware communicates with the operator
Using these components we are able to break down how a virus is able to infect, execute, and replicate on machines. This framework allows us to asses how impactful a virus could potentially be.
### Protection mechanisms
#### Signature based detection
To stand a chance at bypassing AV we need to understand the complexities around its detection mechanisms. This author breaks down the different detection types [@rohith2021comprehensive] Firstly, there is a signature analysis. This involves scanning the file for a specific signature that is found within a known virus, if the signature matches then the file will be reported as suspicious. One major disadvantage of using a detection system like this is that it can only scan for signatures that are known viruses; a new 0-day virus will not be detected by signature based detection.
Because of this we have a heuristic detection system. With the help of probabilistic algorithms it will "scan the file structure with the compliance with the virus patterns are checked". As this technique uses a probability algorithm it will cause false positives from time to time, an example of this may be a file that injects code into another applications memory, such as a mod for a game. As these methods aren't fool proof there is multiple methods that antivirus can use to detect malware. 
#### Behavioural analysis
Another popular type of detection mechanism is the behaviour based method. Unlike signature based detection, behavioural analysis is dynamic, therefore does not share the same shortcomings as signature based detection. The author [@bazrafshan2013survey] breaks down how this detection method works. "Behavioural based detection techniques observe the behaviour of a program to conclude whether it is malicious or not" This means that the AV will break down the core functions of the program and assess whether the functions and how the program executes to determine whether any suspicious activities such as editing registry keys or starting outgoing connections to an unrecognised address. Different strains of malware can all be classified under a single behavioural signature as they may utilise the same type of behaviour. Its important to note that because behavioural analysis is dynamic it does not have the same restraints against 0-day viruses like signature based systems. This strength allows behavioural detection techniques to quarantine suspicious programs where coding techniques like polymorphic coding are employed. Overall, this enables behavioural analysis to detect newer malware as often viruses share the same properties as one another. One disadvantage to using this detection method is for the possibility of a false positive. As some programs may share behaviours that can be found in viruses there is the possibility that the program is flagged as unwanted. An example of this could be a mods for a game downloaded off the internet. As the mods may interfere with the integrity of the games memory, that might be flagged as suspicious and therefore a false positive.
#### Heuristic Detection
In the paper by [@rohith2021comprehensive] Heuristics is defined as a set of rules applied to a program to determine if it contains a virus of not . Heuristic based detection is described as utilizing machine learning and data mining techniques to learn a program's intentions. Heuristic based systems are both static and dynamic. With the static analysis comparing the possible behaviour or the decompiled code with a database. The dynamic analysis will run the program in an isolated environment to observe its operations. These two types of analysis allow the AV to assess the risks of the threat without exposing the users device to a potentially harmful program. Like behavioural analysis there is the disadvantage that there could be false positives. As [@rohith2021comprehensive] suggests, it is impossible to create an algorithm that can definitively distinguish between a virus and an uninfected program with 100% accuracy. 
#### Sandboxing 
The author [@andryani2023detect] explains that a sandbox provides and isolated environment used to execute suspicious binary interactions. A sandbox is a security component for ongoing projects, usually with the ultimate goal of mitigating flaws. It is often used to execute untested or untrusted projects or code. Within Antivirus sandboxing is employed as a virtual machine where potentially harmful files are executed to monitor their actions. [@rohith2021comprehensive] Sandboxes allow the programs to execute freely without risk of damaging or impeding the security of the users device.

Overall these protection mechanisms all have their strengths and weaknesses. For an antivirus system to be reliable and effective, all 4 of these techniques should be employed to provide the most accurate and effective detection. In modern day antivirus systems these techniques will be highly developed and accurate to ensure the best possible security, however that doesn't mean that they're un-evadable.
### Bypass methods
As virus detection techniques have evolved over the years so has the need to create tools that bypass these techniques. The author [@garba2019evaluating] says "Malwares generates using tools such as Metasploit are easily detected nowadays due to the techniques used by antiviruses" As a direct reaction tools have had to evolve to keep up with antivirus detection. In this section I will discuss some popular techniques that malicious users may use to bypass AV.

#### Encryption
The author [@rad2012camouflage] defines encryption as the earliest and simplest method employed by the malware programmers to achieve their goal. The first known encrypted virus appeared in 1987 and was named, Cascade. Encryption can be achieved in many ways, a simple way a payload can be encrypted is through the reversable XOR function. Since this paper more tools have developed such as msfvenom which will take a payload and encrypt using a specified algorithm.
#### Obfuscation
#### Polymorphism
#### Metamorphism


#### Off-The-Shelf Tools


<!--Some techniques employed to bypass AV are encryption, oligomorphism, polymorphism, metamorphism and obfuscation. There are tools out there such as Veil, Avet, TheFatRat and PeCloak.py that aim to quickly create an undetectable executable for us. The problem with these publicly available tools is that AV developers are able to access source code and may patch any exploits that can be abused. -->

As I mentioned in section 1, computer malware infects thousands of companies per day [@jovanovic2023malware] "Every minute, four companies fall victim to ransomware attacks". With more research being poured into discovering the techniques that black hat hackers may use to create a backdoor into a machine, the better chance we have at developing prevention techniques that quarantine these unwanted programs. If we could stop the effectiveness of computer viruses then this would enable a higher level of confidentiality and data integrity, saving companies compensation claims and loss of reputation.

### Papers
#### Paper 1
The author [@kaushik2022systematic] of ‘A systematic approach for evading antiviruses using malware obfuscation’. The paper is from 2022 and describes the process they go through to obfuscate a payload with Graffiti and Veil-Evasion. The purpose of this research is to identify methods that can be used to bypass the antivirus, while mainly focussing on tools such as Veil-Evasion and Graffiti. Similarly to my proposed project the author starts trying to evade antivirus by using readily available tools such as Graffiti and Veil-Evasion. According to the results, Graffiti failed most of the time to avoid the antivirus, and was not effective. However, through the use of Veil-Evasion and a .bat to .exe converter they were able to produce a payload that gave remote root access to a windows machine (bypassing Windows 10 Defender). This is a significant result as it demonstrates that even off-the-shelf tools can be used to bypass Windows 10 Defender. Reviewing this paper gives an insight to the techniques I will need to follow to generate the same results and the methodology I should follow.

The paper also goes into a good depth on how the different tools behave and the outputs they produce. Such as Veil can output the obfuscated payload as a .py, .bat or .exe file. This is important to understand as these tools may be relied upon to create payloads for my future experiments.  In conjunction with using Veil and Graffiti the author also uses “If-else Deletion” to understand which portion of the code is required for the payload to run as intended. They also utilise “Dead code insertion” This allows the payload to be filled with code that won’t affect the execution of the payload but also differs the signature from the genuine payload.

One limitation on this paper is the sample size. The author concludes that “We have shown effectively that we can easily make a malware undetectable utilizing code obfuscation strategies”. Although these results have proved that creating an obfuscated payload can evade antivirus, I do not believe that there is enough evidence to back up this argument, and that the scope is too limited to creating a singular working payload. The paper shows the results of only one payload where Veil-Evasion bypassed 13 out of 59 Antivirus systems. Due to viruses constantly evolving, Antivirus systems have had to keep up in a never ending battle. There is no evidence to suggest that this method for creating a virus is replicable on a large scale.

One strength of this paper is that the conclusion provides an optimal approach on how the research could’ve been finer, “The best system to dodge protector is to make your own obfuscate tools whether that be with a custom obfuscator or transforming them physically by hand.” What this highlights to us is that for virus creation to be effective in bypassing antivirus, tools need to be created where we can obfuscate a payload using polymorphic or metamorphic systems. This would entail creating a payload that can transform its code to ensure that signature based systems wont detect our payloads. The author  [@aliexploring] also exhibits the uses of polymorphic code, and displays some compelling strengths as to how it is useful for programmers when coding in an OOP style approach.

In conclusion this paper has a strong connection with my proposal. The paper has some crucial methodology that is relevant to the approach that I intend to take. The overall results demonstrate that evasion of modern day antivirus systems is possible through the use of readily available tools. The paper is also very clear on the steps that need to be taken to reach the same results, and through this I will do my best to firstly replicate the results and then build upon them.

#### Paper 2
In contrast to the results of this work [@aminu2020evaluating] found concluded that the best evasion tools were Avet and PeCloak.py. "Bypassed most of the selected antivirus by 83% and 67% respectively". These findings are super interesting to us as a later study by [@kaushik2022systematic] was able to bypass Windows 10 defender with Veil. This change in results could be caused by the development in the tools used. [@aminu2020evaluating] aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of selected antivirus systems through the use of evasion tools such as, Veil 3.0, PeCloak.py, Shellter, and a Fat Rat. These tests where conducted against a windows platform. Although these results are older and occurred while testing different antivirus systems to [@kaushik2022systematic] the results are still relevant and need to be understood. Since, Windows Defender and the tools used in this experiment have arguably advanced. This also relates back to section 1, where I emphasise the need for more research to be done over antivirus systems and their counterpart. With technology evolving at exponential rates, so are the tools and techniques that create unwanted programs and leave backdoors into our machines. 

Interestingly, the author talks about how Avet was able to evade so many of the antivirus systems. It seems the main reason for this is the ability for Avet to avoid sandboxing and emulation. "Avet includes two tools, avet.exe and AV evasion technique to avoid sandboxing and emulation". This result opens up many opportunities to explore, if the technique still functions this would allow more simplistic but effective payloads and Windows Defender would have to rely on more dated detection techniques such as signature based detections. 

Some strengths of this paper are that the author used a virtual environment VM to stage both the attacker and the victim machines and connected them together through a NAT setup. This allowed the author to freely create payloads and infect the Windows 10 machines without the consequence of infecting a real machine. The methodology and recording of results were also really clear in this experiment. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of both the antivirus and the evasion tool used. With this data strong conclusions could be made as to what AV systems provide the most protection and what tools rain supreme in evading AV.

In conjunction with [@kalogranis2018antivirus] these authors also conclude that results could be more substantial if the use of hand crafted payloads were employed. This would stop the signature based detection system from flagging files that have come from readily available tools and slow down the speed to which antivirus flags the file as suspicious. Although this is a farfetched idea to hand create every virus, it also demonstrates how the coding techniques such as polymorphic and metamorphic systems could be employed to create more devastating strains of computer virus.
